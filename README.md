This project looks into rebuilding my portfolio website, PaulineNarvas.com. I first built my site in 2017 in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. [You can find the repo here](https://github.com/pawlean/paulinenarvas)

This did the job, but as I started learning more about other frameworks like React and Next.js, and itching to do a little side project, I decided to do this!

# The Tech

- Next.js
- React
- Vercel (for deployment)

# Blog Post

Coming soon - if you're interested in the details and thought process behind this, stay tuned!
