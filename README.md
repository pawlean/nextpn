This project looks into rebuilding my portfolio website, [PaulineNarvas.com](https://PaulineNarvas.com). I first built my site in 2017 in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. [You can find the repo here.](https://github.com/pawlean/paulinenarvas)

This did the job, but as I started learning more about other frameworks like React and Next.js, and itching to do a little side project, I decided to do this!

# The Tech

- Next.js
- React
- Sass / CSS modules
- Vercel (for deployment)
- Dev-environment-as-code  [![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/pawlean/nextpn)
