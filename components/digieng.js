      <h1>ðŸ“± Digital Engineering Graduate</h1>
      <p>
        In September 2018, I joined BT's exciting Graduate Scheme working in the
        Digital Engineering team. Lasting 2 years, this development programme
        allows four 6 month long rotations across the different delivery teams
        within BT Consumer Digital.
