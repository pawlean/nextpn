      <p>
        In September 2018, I joined BT's exciting Graduate Scheme working in the

        After the graduate scheme, I decided that as my first permanent role,
        I'd follow on the DevOps/Cloud path. In July 2020, I rolled off the
        scheme to become a Site Reliability Engineer within BT Consumer Digital
        to contribute to building the platform of the future that is secure,
        cost-efficient, reliable and performant! ðŸš€
