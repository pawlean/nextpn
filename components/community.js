      <h1>ðŸ›  Community Builder & Diversity Advocate</h1>
      <p>
        Community is <em>everything</em>. I've been involved in several
        different communities over the years with the goal of connecting with
        others and creating a better environment for engineers. With diversity
        and inclusion at the core of my community work, I have actively worked
        with groups to help bridge the inequalities in the tech industry,
        focusing speficially on females and people of colour representation.
