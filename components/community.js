      <h1>ðŸ›  Community Builder & Diversity Advocate</h1>
      <p>
        Passionate about creating a better environment for future engineers, I
        actively work with communities to help bridge the inequalities in the
        tech industry, focusing speficially on females and people of colour
        representation. For over 3 years, I've proudly worked with Code First:
        Girls to deliver coding community courses for young women.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        With diversity and inclusion at the core of my community work, I
        pioneered the first Women in Tech student community in Sheffield. Also,
        as part of the MedTech Sheffield committee, I led in bringing students
        from different backgrounds together to events, workshops and hackathons.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, in my role at BT, I am a part of the Gender Equality
        Network (GEN) where I regularly push initiatives at our Leeds base. I
        have also been involved in the furtHER program as a mentor to upskill
        young women into joining the industry.
